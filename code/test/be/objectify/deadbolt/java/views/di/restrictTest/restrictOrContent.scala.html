@(roles: List[Array[String]], deadboltHandler: be.objectify.deadbolt.java.DeadboltHandler)(implicit request: play.mvc.Http.Request)

This is before the constraint.

@restrictOr(roles = roles, handler = deadboltHandler) {
    This is protected by the constraint.
} {
    This is default content in case the constraint denies access to the protected content.
}
